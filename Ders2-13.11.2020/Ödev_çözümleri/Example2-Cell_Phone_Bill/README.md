 A particular cell phone plan includes 50 minutes of air time and 50 text
 messages for $15.00 a month. Each additional minute of air time costs $0.25,
 while additional text messages cost $0.15 each. All cell phone bills include an
 additional charge of $0.44 to support 911 call centers, and the entire bill
(including the 911 charge) is subject to 5 percent sales tax. 

```diff
! Write a program that reads the number of minutes and text messages used in a month from the user.
! Display the base charge, additional minutes charge (if any), 
! additional text message charge (if any), the 911 fee, tax and total bill amount.
! Only display the additional minute and text message charges if the user
! incurred costs in these categories. Ensure that all of the charges are displayed using 2 decimal places.
```
